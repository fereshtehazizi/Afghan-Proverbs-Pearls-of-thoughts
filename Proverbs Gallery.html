   <main>
    <h1>Wisdom And Kindness</h1>
    <div class="list" >
        <div class="in-list">
        <p>" حکمت د باغ په شان ده، که ونه کرل شي، حاصل نه ورکوي "</p>
        <p>"Wisdom is like a garden if not cultivated, it cannot be harvested."</p>
        <p>This beautiful analogy compares wisdom to a garden that must be cared for, watered, and nurtured. Just like a farmer invests time and effort to grow crops, a person must read, learn, reflect, and gain experience to grow in wisdom. The proverb suggests that knowledge without practice is like an untended garden wild and unproductive. It likely originated from Afghanistan’s strong agricultural traditions and the respect for both nature and learning.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="in-list" id="WK1">
        <p>" .از کوزه همان برون تراود که در اوست "</p>
        <p>What comes out of the jug is what’s inside it.</p>
        <p>This proverb teaches that a person’s words and actions reflect their inner character. Just like a jug can only pour out the liquid it contains be it clean water or dirty people can only express what is truly in their hearts. If someone is filled with kindness, wisdom, or honesty, those qualities will naturally show in their behavior. If someone is filled with anger, hatred, or jealousy, that too will reveal itself.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="in-list">
        <p>" مهربانۍ کلی د اوسپنې دروازه خلاصوي "</p>
        <p>"A kind word can open an iron door."</p>
        <p>This proverb shows the immense power of kindness. An “iron door” symbolizes a cold or impossible situation, and a “kind word” symbolizes gentle, respectful speech. The meaning is that even the hardest hearts and the most stubborn people can be influenced not through force, but through compassion. In Afghan society, where honor and pride are strong values, gentle speech has the power to calm anger, prevent conflict, and build trust. This saying may have originated from tribal peace negotiations, where harsh situations were resolved through diplomacy and kind words.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <h1>Patience And Pease</h1>
    <div class="list" id="PP1">
        <div class="in-list" >
        <p>. شب که در میان است، خدا مهربان است</p>
        <p >Even in the middle of the night, Allah is kind.</p>
        <p>This proverb offers deep spiritual comfort: no matter how dark or difficult the situation, God's mercy is always present. “The middle of the night” symbolizes loneliness, despair, or hardship times when we feel forgotten or helpless. This proverb reminds us that even in those darkest moments, hope exists, and divine help is never far away.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="in-list">
        <p>" سوله ییز کور تر سرو زرو قیمتي دی "</p>
        <p> "A peaceful house is worth more than gold."</p>
        <p>This proverb elevates peace in the home above all wealth or luxury. In Afghan culture, where extended families often live together, harmony is essential. The saying emphasizes that without peace between siblings, spouses, or neighbors even a palace feels like a prison. It may have grown popular during times of war, when people realized that peace was the most precious thing they lacked.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="in-list" id="PP3">
        <p>".قطره قطره دریا می‌شود "</p>
        <p>Drop by drop, a river is made.</p>
        <p>This proverb means that great things are built through small, consistent efforts. Each drop of water may seem insignificant on its own, but together they form powerful rivers. It’s a beautiful metaphor for patience, discipline, and the idea that progress though slow adds up over time.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <h1>Hardship And Strength</h1>
    <div class="list" id="HS">
        <div class="in-list">
        <p>.نابرده رنج، گنج میسر نمی‌شود</p>
        <p>No pain, No gain</p>
        <p>This famous proverb means that success and rewards cannot be achieved without effort, struggle, or sacrifice. Whether it’s learning, working, or building something meaningful, one must go through difficulty physical or emotional to reach their goals.
        The "pain" refers to the hard work, discipline, failures, and challenges a person must endure, and the "gain" refers to the benefits like success, strength, or knowledge that come afterward. It’s often used to encourage people to keep going even when things get tough because those efforts will eventually pay off.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="in-list">
        <p>" له هر طوفانه وروسته، لمر راخیږي "</p>
        <p>"After every storm, the sun will shine."</p>
        <p>This is a message of hope. Storms represent chaos, pain, or conflict, and the sun symbolizes recovery, peace, and joy. The proverb teaches that no matter how bad a situation seems, it will eventually get better. This saying is often told to comfort those going through hardship. It may have originated during times of political instability, loss, or natural disasters, as a way to keep hope alive.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="in-list">
        <p>" څوک چې زغم لري، هغه بریالی کېږي "</p>
        <p>"He who endures, conquers."</p>
        <p>This proverb teaches that patience, endurance, and emotional strength lead to success more than physical power or wealth. The word "conquers" doesn’t just mean winning battles, but also surviving life’s challenges. In Afghanistan’s tribal traditions, people admire those who are emotionally strong and can endure suffering with dignity. This saying reflects the Afghan value of sabr (patience) as a form of bravery.</p>
